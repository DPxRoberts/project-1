# project-1
First python project of a cash register balancing app. 

I first came up with this idea from a program I saw at 
work for a dispensary. While counting in our drawers, the main program
that we use on our cash registers has something similar to what 
I coded here. 

“I wish I could have that in my phone”! I said to myself. So 
I did some research and found that python would do the job. 
It took me three days to write and finish this project. 

Please, let me know how I can improve or better this project. 
My next step is to add a GI.
